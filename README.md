# Credit-scoring-model-
A Credit Scoring Model is a statistical or machine learning model that evaluates the creditworthiness of an individual or organization based on their financial history, demographic details, and behavioral patterns. The goal is to predict whether an applicant is likely to repay a loan (Good credit) or default (Bad credit).
🔑 Key Points:

Objective: Assess the probability of default (PD) or classify applicants as “Good” or “Bad” credit risks.

Inputs (Features):

Income, employment status

Debt-to-income ratio

Credit history & repayment behavior

Number of open loans/credit cards

Demographic attributes (age, marital status, etc.)

Output (Target):

Classification → Good credit (low risk) / Bad credit (high risk)

Probability score → likelihood of default

⚙️ How It Works:

Data Collection – Historical records of past applicants and their repayment outcomes.

Preprocessing – Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, normalization/scaling of numeric values.

Feature Engineering – Creating useful features like debt-to-income ratio, credit utilization rate, etc.

Model Training – Using algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

XGBoost / Gradient Boosting

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy → Overall correctness

Precision & Recall → Handling imbalance (false approvals vs false rejections)

F1-score → Balance between precision & recall

ROC-AUC → Model’s ability to separate Good vs Bad credit cases

📊 Why It Matters:

Banks / Financial Institutions use credit scoring to decide whether to approve a loan or credit card.

Reduces Risk of financial losses by filtering out high-risk applicants.

Automates Decisions → Faster, consistent, and more objective loan approvals.
